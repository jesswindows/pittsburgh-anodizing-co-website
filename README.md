# pittsburgh-anodizing-co-website

This is a simple HTML project for a family company. It is a modernized version of the orginal site. At the moment, the other tabs on the navbar
link back to the original site. To show the comparison between the two and to have it set up for future development.

I learned the basics of HTML and CSS. From the basics, I was then able to employ Bootstrap to help with formatting my site to make it look nicer.
I also just made and am still learning how to use my github account.
